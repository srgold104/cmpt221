Introduction
============
Bookmark is a social media platform for lovers of the written word. 
It is designed to allow avid readers, authors and anyone interested 
in books of all kinds to interact. Users will be able to share their 
thoughts and experiences with different books, engage in discussions 
and make recommendations. Authors will be able to announce new works, 
engage with their audience and offer insight on the stories they weave.
Unlike other options on the internet, Bookmark will go beyond simple 
book reviews. Bookmark will give readers an outlet to share their 
thoughts both in real-time discussions and asynchronous posts. 
Through the process of reviewing and discussing books, users 
will generate a profile that will connect them with readers 
around the world that share their interests and insights.
To join the Bookmark community, simply navigate to the home page: www.bookmark.com. 
Create a user account and indicate if you are a reader or an author. 
Authors will require additional authentication. 
By following the steps of creating an account, the reader profile is beginning 
to take form. The more a user interacts with other users, the more accurate the 
reader profile will become.

The primary design group includes: Rian Dickman, Annadaliah Guarino, Oscar Bjering, Anthony Cappella, and Seth Goldstein
